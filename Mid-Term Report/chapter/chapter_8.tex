\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Code Optimization:}
       The model which we are using to train is not making full use of the GPU thus affecting training speed considerably. So we have to optimize the code in order to make the proper use of the resources we have on hand.
       
    \item \textbf{Lip segmentation:}
       Since we only worked with one speaker the frame slicing technique worked for lip-segmentation but for training on other speakers as well the frame slicing may not work because the the framing of the video may differ in each speakers.

    \item \textbf{User Interface:}
       We have to also design a User Interface where we can choose any video of our liking to hear the video and look and verify the output generated by our model.
