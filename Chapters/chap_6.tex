\chapter{Expected Outcomes}
The Lipreading algorithm is expected to speech recognition better by usage of especially in noisy places. Anticipated outcomes involve achieving enhanced accuracy through the integration of cutting-edge deep learning architectures and ensemble learning techniques. Furthermore, the objective is to help people with hearing impairments and improve the accuracy in audiovisual applications.
