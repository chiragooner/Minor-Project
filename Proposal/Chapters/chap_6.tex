\chapter{Expected Outcomes}
The Lipreading algorithm is expected to recognize speech better by usage of visual clue given by lip movement especially in noisy places. Anticipated outcomes involve achieving enhanced accuracy through the integration of cutting-edge deep learning architectures and ensemble learning techniques. Furthermore, the objective is to help people with hearing impairments and improve the accuracy in audiovisual applications.
